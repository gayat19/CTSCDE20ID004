SOLID
Single Responsibility
Open Closed
Liskov Substitution
Interface Segregation
Dependency Inversion

Single Responsibility
   A class should be responsible only for actions of that entity

Open Closed
  Open for extension
  Clased for modification

Liskov Substitution
   Any Child class object should replace a parent's object without any modifications required

Interface Segregation
  A class should not be forced to implement an interface
  Do not create fat interfaces(with too many methods)

Dependency Inversion
  Connect in abstract level. High level class should not be dependent directly on low level class
